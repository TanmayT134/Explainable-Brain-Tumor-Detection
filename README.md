---

## 📌 Overview

This project presents an **AI-powered diagnostic system** that detects and classifies brain tumors from MRI scans using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.

Unlike traditional models, this system integrates **Explainable AI (XAI)** using **Grad-CAM**, allowing users to visually understand *why* the model made a prediction.

It is deployed as an **interactive web application** built with Streamlit.

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 Brain tumor classification from MRI images  
- 📊 Multiclass prediction (4 tumor categories)  
- 🔥 Grad-CAM visualization for explainability  
- 📈 Confidence score & probability distribution  
- ⚠️ Uncertainty detection  
- 🔍 Image quality assessment  
- 📄 Clinical-style PDF report generation  
- 🌐 Fully deployed web application

## 🧬 Tumor Classes

| Class | Description |
|------|------------|
| Glioma | Tumor in brain/glial cells |
| Meningioma | Tumor in brain membranes |
| Pituitary | Tumor in pituitary gland |
| No Tumor | Normal brain MRI |

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Key Layers:
  - Convolution + ReLU  
  - Max Pooling  
  - Fully Connected Layers  
  - Softmax Output

## 🔬 Explainable AI (Grad-CAM)

Grad-CAM provides **visual explanations** by highlighting regions in the MRI scan that influenced the model’s decision.

> ⚠️ *Note:* Grad-CAM shows model attention, not exact tumor boundaries.
